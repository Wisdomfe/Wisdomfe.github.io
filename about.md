# About

I am a  civil engineer holding a post graduate diploma in financial mathematics from Alma Mater Studiorum University of Bologna.
I love financial markets and apply math to try to solve the market puzzle. At moment I am following the FastAI course from University of San Francisco.
My next goal is to develop A.I. application for Financial markets.
